    "In this assignment we will learn how to preform efficient inference and learning in directed graphical models with continuous latent variables.We will use stochastic variational inference with automatic differentiation (SADVI) to approximate intractible posterior distributions. \n",
    "We will implement the two gradient estimators discussed in lecture, Score Function and Reparamterization, and experimentally demonstrate their properties such as biasedness and variance. \n",
    "We will use the reparameterization gradient estimators to optimize the ELBO of our latent variable model.\n",

    "You can use automatic differentiation in your code.\n",
    "You may also use a machine learning framework to specify the encoder and decoder neural networks, and provide gradientent optimizers such as ADAM.\n",
    "However, you may not use any probabilistic modelling elements for these frameworks.\n",
    "In particular, sampling from and evaluating densities under distributions must be written by you."
