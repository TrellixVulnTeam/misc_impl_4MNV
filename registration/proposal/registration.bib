Recently, learning-based methods have facilitated fast registration by learning spatial deformation functions. However, these approaches use restricted deformation models, require supervised labels, or do not guarantee a diffeomorphic (topology-preserving) registration.

	abstract = {The authors consider elastic image registration based on a set of corresponding anatomical point landmarks and approximating thin-plate splines. This approach is an extension of the original interpolating thin-plate spline approach and allows to take into account landmark localization errors. The extension is important for clinical applications since landmark extraction is always prone to error. The authors' approach is based on a minimizing functional and can cope with isotropic as well as anisotropic landmark errors. In particular, in the latter case it is possible to include different types of landmarks, e.g., unique point landmarks as well as arbitrary edge points. Also, the scheme is general with respect to the image dimension and the order of smoothness of the underlying functional. Optimal affine transformations as well as interpolating thin-plate splines are special cases of this scheme. To localize landmarks the authors use a semi-automatic approach which is based on three-dimensional (3-D) differential operators. Experimental results are presented for two-dimensional as well as 3-D tomographic images of the human brain.},

	abstract = {In this paper the authors present a new approach for the nonrigid registration of contrast-enhanced breast {MRI}. A hierarchical transformation model of the motion of the breast has been developed. The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation ({FFD}) based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast {MRI} in volunteers and patients. In particular, the authors have compared the results of the proposed nonrigid registration algorithm to those obtained using rigid and affine registration techniques. The results clearly indicate that the nonrigid registration algorithm is much better able to recover the motion and deformation of the breast than rigid or affine registration algorithms.},

In the second part of this paper, we adapt the optimization procedure underlying the demons algorithm to a space of diffeomorphic transformations. In contrast to many diffeomorphic registration algorithms, our solution is computationally efficient since in practice it only replaces an addition of displacement fields by a few compositions. Our experiments show that in addition to being diffeomorphic, our algorithm provides results that are similar to the ones from the demons algorithm but with transformations that are much smoother and closer to the gold standard, available in controlled experiments, in terms of Jacobians.},

Specifically, we design a patch-based deep encoder-decoder network which learns the pixel/voxel-wise mapping between image appearance and registration parameters. Our approach can predict general deformation parameterizations, however, we focus on the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping ({LDDMM}) registration model. By predicting the {LDDMM} momentum-parameterization we retain the desirable theoretical properties of {LDDMM}, while reducing computation time by orders of magnitude: combined with patch pruning, we achieve a 1500x/66x speed up compared to {GPU}-based optimization for 2D/3D image registration. Our approach has better prediction accuracy than predicting deformation or velocity fields and results in diffeomorphic transformations. Additionally, we create a Bayesian probabilistic version of our network, which allows evaluation of deformation field uncertainty through Monte Carlo sampling using dropout at test time. We show that deformation uncertainty highlights areas of ambiguous deformations. We test our method on the {OASIS} brain image dataset in 2D and 3D.},

	title = {An Artificial Agent for Robust Image Registration},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10336},
	abstract = {3-D image registration, which involves aligning two or more images, is a critical step in a variety of medical applications from diagnosis to therapy. Image registration is commonly performed by optimizing an image matching metric as a cost function. However, this task is challenging due to the non-convex nature of the matching metric over the plausible registration parameter space and insufficient approaches for a robust optimization. As a result, current approaches are often customized to a specific problem and sensitive to image quality and artifacts. In this paper, we propose a completely different approach to image registration, inspired by how experts perform the task. We first cast the image registration problem as a "strategy learning" process, where the goal is to find the best sequence of motion actions (e.g. up, down, etc.) that yields image alignment. Within this approach, an artificial agent is learned, modeled using deep convolutional neural networks, with 3D raw image data as the input, and the next optimal action as the output. To cope with the dimensionality of the problem, we propose a greedy supervised approach for an end-to-end training, coupled with attention-driven hierarchical strategy. The resulting registration approach inherently encodes both a data-driven matching metric and an optimal registration strategy (policy). We demonstrate, on two 3-D/3-D medical image registration examples with drastically different nature of challenges, that the artificial agent outperforms several state-of-art registration methods by a large margin in terms of both accuracy and robustness.},

Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia ({FTD}) and Alzheimer's disease ({AD}), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method ({SyN}) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast {SyN}'s performance with a related elastic method and with the standard {ITK} implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of {FTD} and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, {SyN}'s volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that {SyN}, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric {MRI} of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

Time-course analysis for in-utero volumetric {MRI} time series often suffers from substantial and unpredictable fetal motion. Registration provides voxel correspondences between images and is commonly employed for motion correction. Current registration methods often fail when aligning images that are substantially different from a template (reference image). To achieve accurate and robust alignment, we make a Markov assumption on the nature of motion and take advantage of the temporal smoothness in the image data. Forward message passing in the corresponding hidden Markov model ({HMM}) yields an estimation algorithm that only has to account for relatively small motion between consecutive frames. We evaluate the utility of the temporal model in the context of in-utero {MRI} time series alignment by examining the accuracy of propagated segmentation label maps.

	abstract = {This paper introduces the use of unbalanced optimal transport methods as a similarity measure for diffeomorphic matching of imaging data. The similarity measure is a key object in diffeomorphic registration methods that, together with the regularization on the deformation, defines the optimal deformation. Most often, these similarity measures are local or non local but simple enough to be computationally fast. We build on recent theoretical and numerical advances in optimal transport to propose fast and global similarity measures that can be used on surfaces or volumetric imaging data. This new similarity measure is computed using a fast generalized Sinkhorn algorithm. We apply this new metric in the {LDDMM} framework on synthetic and real data, fibres bundles and surfaces and show that better matching results are obtained.},

	doi = {10.1109/CVPRW.2016.84},
	abstract = {In quantitative magnetic resonance imaging ({qMRI}), quantitative tissue properties can be estimated by fitting a signal model to the voxel intensities of a series of images acquired with different settings. To obtain reliable quantitative measures, it is necessary that the {qMRI} images are spatially aligned so that a given voxel corresponds in all images to the same anatomical location. The objective of the present study is to describe and evaluate a novel automatic groupwise registration technique using a dissimilarity metric based on an approximated form of total correlation. The proposed registration method is applied to five {qMRI} datasets of various anatomical locations, and the obtained registration performances are compared to these of a conventional pairwise registration based on mutual information. The results show that groupwise total correlation yields better registration performances than pairwise mutual information. This study also establishes that the formulation of approximated total correlation is quite analogous to two other groupwise metrics based on principal component analysis ({PCA}). Registration performances of total correlation and these two {PCA}-based techniques are therefore compared. The results show that total correlation yields performances that are analogous to these of the {PCA}-based techniques. However, compared to these {PCA}-based metrics, total correlation has two main advantages. Firstly, it is directly derived from a multivariate form of mutual information, while the {PCA}-based metrics were obtained empirically. Secondly, total correlation has the advantage of requiring no user-defined parameter.},

This allows robust separation of motion components that can be registered, from intensity variations that are left unchanged. This Robust Data Decomposition Registration ({RDDR}) is demonstrated on both simulated and a wide range of clinical data. Robustness to different types of motion and breathing choices during acquisition is demonstrated for a variety of imaged organs including liver, small bowel and prostate. The analysis of clinically relevant regions of interest showed both a decrease of error (15–62\% reduction following registration) in tissue time–intensity curves and improved areas under the curve ({AUC}60) at early enhancement.},

	abstract = {Knowing how the Human brain is anatomically and functionally organized at the level of a group of healthy individuals or patients is the primary goal of neuroimaging research. Yet computing an average of brain imaging data defined over a voxel grid or a triangulation remains a challenge. Data are large, the geometry of the brain is complex and the between subjects variability leads to spatially or temporally non-overlapping effects of interest. To address the problem of variability, data are commonly smoothed before group linear averaging. In this work we build on ideas originally introduced by Kantorovich to propose a new algorithm that can average efficiently non-normalized data defined over arbitrary discrete domains using transportation metrics. We show how Kantorovich means can be linked to Wasserstein barycenters in order to take advantage of an entropic smoothing approach. It leads to a smooth convex optimization problem and an algorithm with strong convergence guarantees. We illustrate the versatility of this tool and its empirical behavior on functional neuroimaging data, functional {MRI} and magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) source estimates, defined on voxel grids and triangulations of the folded cortical surface.},

	abstract = {We introduce a region-specific diffeomorphic metric mapping ({RDMM}) registration approach. {RDMM} is non-parametric, estimating spatio-temporal velocity fields which parameterize the sought-for spatial transformation. Regularization of these velocity fields is necessary. However, while existing non-parametric registration approaches, e.g., the large displacement diffeomorphic metric mapping ({LDDMM}) model, use a fixed spatially-invariant regularization our model advects a spatially-varying regularizer with the estimated velocity field, thereby naturally attaching a spatio-temporal regularizer to deforming objects. We explore a family of {RDMM} registration approaches: 1) a registration model where regions with separate regularizations are pre-defined (e.g., in an atlas space), 2) a registration model where a general spatially-varying regularizer is estimated, and 3) a registration model where the spatially-varying regularizer is obtained via an end-to-end trained deep learning ({DL}) model. We provide a variational derivation of {RDMM}, show that the model can assure diffeomorphic transformations in the continuum, and that {LDDMM} is a particular instance of {RDMM}. To evaluate {RDMM} performance we experiment 1) on synthetic 2D data and 2) on two 3D datasets: knee magnetic resonance images ({MRIs}) of the Osteoarthritis Initiative ({OAI}) and computed tomography images ({CT}) of the lung. Results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art image registration performance, while providing additional information via a learned spatio-temoporal regularizer. Further, our deep learning approach allows for very fast {RDMM} and {LDDMM} estimations. Our code will be open-sourced. Code is available at https://github.com/uncbiag/registration.},

We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell’s demons. We show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical ﬂow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images. Finally, we present results with synthesized deformations and real medical images, with applications to heart motion tracking and three-dimensional inter-patients matching.},

	abstract = {Deep learning based 3D reconstruction techniques have recently achieved impressive results. However, while stateof-the-art methods are able to output complex 3D geometry, it is not clear how to extend these results to time-varying topologies. Approaches treating each time step individually lack continuity and exhibit slow inference, while traditional 4D reconstruction methods often utilize a template model or discretize the 4D space at ﬁxed resolution. In this work, we present Occupancy Flow, a novel spatio-temporal representation of time-varying 3D geometry with implicit correspondences. Towards this goal, we learn a temporally and spatially continuous vector ﬁeld which assigns a motion vector to every point in space and time. In order to perform dense 4D reconstruction from images or sparse point clouds, we combine our method with a continuous 3D representation. Implicitly, our model yields correspondences over time, thus enabling fast inference while providing a sound physical description of the temporal dynamics. We show that our method can be used for interpolation and reconstruction tasks, and demonstrate the accuracy of the learned correspondences. We believe that Occupancy Flow is a promising new 4D representation which will be useful for a variety of spatio-temporal reconstruction tasks.},

	volume = {60},
	abstract = {Image registration is the process of establishing a common geometric reference frame between two or more image data sets possibly taken at different times. In this paper we present a method for computing elastic registration and warping maps based on the Monge–Kantorovich theory of optimal mass transport. This mass transport method has a number of important characteristics. First, it is parameter free. Moreover, it utilizes all of the grayscale data in both images, places the two images on equal footing and is symmetrical: the optimal mapping from image to ¡ image being the inverse of the optimal mapping ¡ from to  £ ¢ The method does not require that landmarks be specified, and the minimizer of the distance functional involved is unique; there are no other local minimizers. Finally, optimal transport naturally takes into account changes in density that result from changes in area or volume. Although the optimal transport method is certainly not appropriate for all registration and warping problems, this mass preservation property makes the Monge-Kantorovich approach quite useful for an interesting class of warping problems, as we show in this paper. Our method for finding the registration mapping is based on a partial differential equation approach to the minimization of ¤¦ ¥ the Kantorovich–Wasserstein or “Earth Mover’s Distance ” under a mass preservation constraint. We show how this approach leads to practical algorithms, and demonstrate our method with a number of examples, including those from the medical field. We also extended this method to take into account changes in intensity, and show that it is well suited for applications such as image morphing. A. Image Registration I.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11906},
	abstract = {We propose a variational model with diffeomorphic optimal transportation for joint image reconstruction and motion estimation. The proposed model is a production of assembling the Wasserstein distance with the Benamou--Brenier formula in optimal transportation and the flow of diffeomorphisms involved in large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping, which is suitable for the scenario of spatiotemporal imaging with large diffeomorphic and mass-preserving deformations. Specifically, we first use the Benamou--Brenier formula to characterize the optimal transport cost among the flow of mass-preserving images, and restrict the velocity field into the admissible Hilbert space to guarantee the generated deformation flow being diffeomorphic. We then gain the {ODE}-constrained equivalent formulation for Benamou--Brenier formula. We finally obtain the proposed model with {ODE} constraint following the framework that presented in our previous work. We further get the equivalent {PDE}-constrained optimal control formulation. The proposed model is compared against several existing alternatives theoretically. The alternating minimization algorithm is presented for solving the time-discretized version of the proposed model with {ODE} constraint. Several important issues on the proposed model and associated algorithms are also discussed. Particularly, we present several potential models based on the proposed diffeomorphic optimal transportation. Under appropriate conditions, the proposed algorithm also provides a new scheme to solve the models using quadratic Wasserstein distance. The performance is finally evaluated by several numerical experiments in space-time tomography, where the data is measured from the concerned sequential images with sparse views and/or various noise levels.},

In contrast to existing methods, our framework generates anatomically meaningful images via interpolation from the geodesic subspace underlying given samples. Our approach consists of three steps: 1) given a source image and a set of target images, we construct a geodesic subspace using the Large Deformation Diﬀeomorphic Metric Mapping ({LDDMM}) model; 2) we sample transformations from the resulting geodesic subspace; 3) we obtain deformed images and segmentations via interpolation. Experiments on brain ({LPBA}) and knee ({OAI}) data illustrate the performance of our approach on two tasks: 1) data augmentation during training and testing for image segmentation; 2) one-shot learning for single atlas image segmentation. We demonstrate that our approach generates anatomically meaningful data and improves performance on these tasks over competing approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/uncbiag/easyreg.},

	abstract = {Visualization and analysis of intra-operative images in imageguided radiotherapy and surgery are mainly limited to 2D X-ray imaging, which could be beneficially fused with information-rich pre-operative 3D image information by means of 3D-2D image registration. To keep the radiation dose delivered by the X-ray system low, the intra-operative imaging is usually limited to a single projection view. Registration of 3D to a single 2D image is a very challenging registration task for most of current state-of-the-art 3D-2D image registration methods. We propose a novel 3D-2D rigid registration method based on evaluation of similarity between corresponding 3D and 2D gradient covariances, which are mapped into the same space using backprojection. Normalized scalar product of covariances is computed as similarity measure. Performance of the proposed and state-of-the-art 3D-2D image registration methods was evaluated on two publicly available image datasets, one of cerebral angiograms and the other of a spine cadaver, using standardized evaluation methodology. Results showed that the proposed method outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods and achieved registration accuracy of 0.5 mm, capture range of 9 mm and success rate {\textgreater}80\%. Considering also that {GPU}-enabled execution times ranged from 0.5-2.0 seconds, the proposed method has the potential to enhance with 3D information the visualization and analysis of intra-operative 2D images.},
