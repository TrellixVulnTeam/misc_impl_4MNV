	abstract = {Classical deformable registration techniques achieve impressive results and offer a rigorous theoretical treatment, but are computationally intensive since they solve an optimization problem for each image pair. Recently, learning-based methods have facilitated fast registration by learning spatial deformation functions. However, these approaches use restricted deformation models, require supervised labels, or do not guarantee a diffeomorphic (topology-preserving) registration. Furthermore, learning-based registration tools have not been derived from a probabilistic framework that can offer uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we build a connection between classical and learning-based methods. We present a probabilistic generative model and derive an unsupervised learning-based inference algorithm that uses insights from classical registration methods and makes use of recent developments in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We demonstrate our method on a 3D brain registration task for both images and anatomical surfaces, and provide extensive empirical analyses. Our principled approach results in state of the art accuracy and very fast runtimes, while providing diffeomorphic guarantees. Our implementation is available at http://voxelmorph.csail.mit.edu.},

introduction 

a survey of papers on probabilistic generative model for doing deformable registration

63,70,31,58,3


learning-based registration

method that uses CVAE to learn stationary velocity field


surface-based registration

3D point cloud using ICP
VoxelMorph uses 3D point representation jointly with images to achieve fast registration with neural networks, enabled by a differentiable surface distance function



method 

generative model 

note moving image are parameters for mean of the likelihood function. m is a fixed parameter that changes for different image pairs.
posterior distribution Gaussian with diagonal covariance

voxel-wise mean
voxel-wise variance




surface-based registration

model anatomical structures in images using segmentation
additional loss term encourages deformation to warp the moving surface close to the fixed surface
needs point-to-point correspondence to compute the loss, which is not available with segmentation alone
approximation

signed distance function
approximate the 3rd loss term by adding signed distance of all points in surface 1 to surface 2 and vice versa


in summary: at training time, the network uses both warped image and a warped surface to evaluate the quality of the registration


non-diagonal covariance

new covariance is the smoothed diagonal matrix using Gaussian kernel
smoother velocity field, whose effect diminishes as lambda goes higher. So diagonal covariance is a good approximation



results

model trained using surface loss

improvement in DICE


controled experiment

showed that

no folding pixels
deformation field invertible




test different number of scale and squaring ODE integration layer affect diffeomorphic properties

more efficient than differentiable ODE solvers


velocity sampling

empirical variance for samples from non-diagonal covariance matrix smaller than samples from diagonal covariance matrix ?

This approach is an extension of the original interpolating thin-plate spline approach and allows to take into account landmark localization errors. The extension is important for clinical applications since landmark extraction is always prone to error. The authors' approach is based on a minimizing functional and can cope with isotropic as well as anisotropic landmark errors. In particular, in the latter case it is possible to include different types of landmarks, e.g., unique point landmarks as well as arbitrary edge points. Also, the scheme is general with respect to the image dimension and the order of smoothness of the underlying functional. Optimal affine transformations as well as interpolating thin-plate splines are special cases of this scheme. To localize landmarks the authors use a semi-automatic approach which is based on three-dimensional (3-D) differential operators. Experimental results are presented for two-dimensional as well as 3-D tomographic images of the human brain.},

A hierarchical transformation model of the motion of the breast has been developed. The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation (FFD) based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast MRI in volunteers and patients. In particular, the authors have compared the results of the proposed nonrigid registration algorithm to those obtained using rigid and affine registration techniques. The results clearly indicate that the nonrigid registration algorithm is much better able to recover the motion and deformation of the breast than rigid or affine registration algorithms.},

Our approach can predict general deformation parameterizations, however, we focus on the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) registration model. By predicting the LDDMM momentum-parameterization we retain the desirable theoretical properties of LDDMM, while reducing computation time by orders of magnitude: combined with patch pruning, we achieve a 1500x/66x speed up compared to GPU-based optimization for 2D/3D image registration. Our approach has better prediction accuracy than predicting deformation or velocity fields and results in diffeomorphic transformations. Additionally, we create a Bayesian probabilistic version of our network, which allows evaluation of deformation field uncertainty through Monte Carlo sampling using dropout at test time.

	title = {An {Artificial} {Agent} for {Robust} {Image} {Registration}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10336},
	abstract = {3-D image registration, which involves aligning two or more images, is a critical step in a variety of medical applications from diagnosis to therapy. Image registration is commonly performed by optimizing an image matching metric as a cost function. However, this task is challenging due to the non-convex nature of the matching metric over the plausible registration parameter space and insufficient approaches for a robust optimization. As a result, current approaches are often customized to a specific problem and sensitive to image quality and artifacts. In this paper, we propose a completely different approach to image registration, inspired by how experts perform the task. We first cast the image registration problem as a "strategy learning" process, where the goal is to find the best sequence of motion actions (e.g. up, down, etc.) that yields image alignment. Within this approach, an artificial agent is learned, modeled using deep convolutional neural networks, with 3D raw image data as the input, and the next optimal action as the output. To cope with the dimensionality of the problem, we propose a greedy supervised approach for an end-to-end training, coupled with attention-driven hierarchical strategy. The resulting registration approach inherently encodes both a data-driven matching metric and an optimal registration strategy (policy). We demonstrate, on two 3-D/3-D medical image registration examples with drastically different nature of challenges, that the artificial agent outperforms several state-of-art registration methods by a large margin in terms of both accuracy and robustness.},

Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

	abstract = {Traditional deformable registration techniques achieve impressive results and offer a rigorous theoretical treatment, but are computationally intensive since they solve an optimization problem for each image pair. Recently, learning-based methods have facilitated fast registration by learning spatial deformation functions. However, these approaches use restricted deformation models, require supervised labels, or do not guarantee a diffeomorphic (topology-preserving) registration. Furthermore, learning-based registration tools have not been derived from a probabilistic framework that can offer uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we present a probabilistic generative model and derive an unsupervised learning-based inference algorithm that makes use of recent developments in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We demonstrate our method on a 3D brain registration task, and provide an empirical analysis of the algorithm. Our approach results in state of the art accuracy and very fast runtimes, while providing diffeomorphic guarantees and uncertainty estimates.

introduction

amortized inference 

traditional: optimize each volume pair, expensive
voxelmorph:

assume field can be computed by a paramterized function of data (CNN)
optimization of parameter for the entire dataset!


replace optimization between image pairs to generate registration, to learning a map (with global parameters) that directly computes the registration
references

semi-amortized VAE  https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02550 
amortized MAP inference for image super-resolution




good reference on medical image registration
segmentation map is important in training registrations
optical flow

method 

auxiliary data loss function (segmentation loss)

Dice(fixed\_seg\_mask, deformed\_seg\_mask) 
sum of Dice over all anatomical structures
implemented as stacking the mask for K anatomical structures into K channels


amortized optimization interpretation

shared global parameter for mapping to deformation field act as a regularizer !
instance-specific optimization: VoxelMorph output is an approximation to optimal registration field, can do iterative refinement (using GD) to fine-tune the VoxelMorph output !



experiments

datasets

atlas (f) and moving image (m)

atlas always the same!




experiments

hyper-parameter sensitivity

vary by {\textasciitilde}0.5 max


training set size on performance

{\textasciitilde}1000 volumes, test/training set same performance, matching performance of ANTs
instance-specific optimization is even better!


trained on auxiliary segmentation data

VoxelMorph with good manual segmentation data significantly out-performed ANTs and unsupervised VoxelMorph
VoxelMorph trained using coarse segmentation masks is 3 DICE score better than ANTs (with some good gamma!)


trained using random pairs (non-atlas) from dataset

NCC more robust!
instance-specific opt DICE comparable to ANTs




evaluation metrics

ground truth registration not well-defined, since many registration fields yield similar looking warped image
quality

volume overlap of anatomical segmentations


regularity of deformation fields

count {\textbar}Jacobian{\textbar} {\textless}= 0, i.e. 3x3 matrix at each voxel, i.e. when deformation not diffeomorphic




baseline

SyN
NiftyReg



conclusion

training dataset need not be large: {\textasciitilde}100 is good enough to get performance comparable to ANTs
instance-specific optimization further improves performance by 1 DICE point
with a good choice of hyperparameter, segmentation (either anatomical segmentation or coarse segmentation mask) during training improves test registration performance !

Time-course analysis for in-utero volumetric MRI time series often suffers from substantial and unpredictable fetal motion. Registration provides voxel correspondences between images and is commonly employed for motion correction. Current registration methods often fail when aligning images that are substantially different from a template (reference image). To achieve accurate and robust alignment, we make a Markov assumption on the nature of motion and take advantage of the temporal smoothness in the image data. Forward message passing in the corresponding hidden Markov model (HMM) yields an estimation algorithm that only has to account for relatively small motion between consecutive frames. We evaluate the utility of the temporal model in the context of in-utero MRI time series alignment by examining the accuracy of propagated segmentation label maps. Our results suggest that the proposed model captures accurately the temporal dynamics of transformations in in-utero MRI time series.},

We build on recent theoretical and numerical advances in optimal transport to propose fast and global similarity measures that can be used on surfaces or volumetric imaging data.

the idea of doing OT over feature space seems quite good. is there a proper feature space for volumetric registration? in the context of groupwise registration ?

something like groupwise volumetric registration using unbalanced OT ? groupwise -{\textgreater} {\textgreater}2 OT
registration in the space of velocity fields ?


future work includes extension to volumetric registration. think about this more ... might be interesting.
the data are delta measures ... and the deformation map is a point estimate as well

extension to bayesian setup ?

	abstract = {In quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI), quantitative tissue properties can be estimated by fitting a signal model to the voxel intensities of a series of images acquired with different settings. To obtain reliable quantitative measures, it is necessary that the qMRI images are spatially aligned so that a given voxel corresponds in all images to the same anatomical location. The objective of the present study is to describe and evaluate a novel automatic groupwise registration technique using a dissimilarity metric based on an approximated form of total correlation. The proposed registration method is applied to five qMRI datasets of various anatomical locations, and the obtained registration performances are compared to these of a conventional pairwise registration based on mutual information. The results show that groupwise total correlation yields better registration performances than pairwise mutual information. This study also establishes that the formulation of approximated total correlation is quite analogous to two other groupwise metrics based on principal component analysis (PCA). Registration performances of total correlation and these two PCA-based techniques are therefore compared. The results show that total correlation yields performances that are analogous to these of the PCA-based techniques. However, compared to these PCA-based metrics, total correlation has two main advantages. Firstly, it is directly derived from a multivariate form of mutual information, while the PCA-based metrics were obtained empirically. Secondly, total correlation has the advantage of requiring no user-defined parameter.},

Yet computing an average of brain imaging data defined over a voxel grid or a triangulation remains a challenge. Data are large, the geometry of the brain is complex and the between subjects variability leads to spatially or temporally non-overlapping effects of interest. To address the problem of variability, data are commonly smoothed before group linear averaging. In this work we build on ideas originally introduced by Kantorovich to propose a new algorithm that can average efficiently non-normalized data defined over arbitrary discrete domains using transportation metrics. We show how Kantorovich means can be linked to Wasserstein barycenters in order to take advantage of an entropic smoothing approach.

An added beneﬁt of this stochastic approach is that it can successfully solve diﬃcult registration problems involving large deformations, where direct geodesic optimization fails. Using synthetic data generated from the forward model with known parameters, we demonstrate the ability of our model to successfully recover the atlas and regularization parameters.

	abstract = {We introduce a region-specific diffeomorphic metric mapping (RDMM) registration approach. RDMM is non-parametric, estimating spatio-temporal velocity fields which parameterize the sought-for spatial transformation. Regularization of these velocity fields is necessary. However, while existing non-parametric registration approaches, e.g., the large displacement diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) model, use a fixed spatially-invariant regularization our model advects a spatially-varying regularizer with the estimated velocity field, thereby naturally attaching a spatio-temporal regularizer to deforming objects. We explore a family of RDMM registration approaches: 1) a registration model where regions with separate regularizations are pre-defined (e.g., in an atlas space), 2) a registration model where a general spatially-varying regularizer is estimated, and 3) a registration model where the spatially-varying regularizer is obtained via an end-to-end trained deep learning (DL) model. We provide a variational derivation of RDMM, show that the model can assure diffeomorphic transformations in the continuum, and that LDDMM is a particular instance of RDMM. To evaluate RDMM performance we experiment 1) on synthetic 2D data and 2) on two 3D datasets: knee magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and computed tomography images (CT) of the lung. Results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art image registration performance, while providing additional information via a learned spatio-temoporal regularizer. Further, our deep learning approach allows for very fast RDMM and LDDMM estimations. Our code will be open-sourced. Code is available at https://github.com/uncbiag/registration.},

We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell’s demons. We show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical ﬂow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images. Finally, we present results with synthesized deformations and real medical images, with applications to heart motion tracking and three-dimensional inter-patients matching.},

extend OT  reg to bayesian ?
might want to optimize for covariance as well ... is it that optimal q(v) must have same covariance ? or a free form covariance would be better ?
some points understood after re-reading

phi is a GP as well ... the mean of GP is average deformation map.
landmarks simply mean M,F are points in 2d/3d ... map discrete points to discrete points and.
the Sim(M,F) = norm(M-F) simply log scale of kernel rbf kernel matrix ...
Eq (21) actually uses 2nd order variance for variational q(phi) when computing the first term.
the sigma of SE kernel of GP is model parameter and not optimized during optimization ... they are hyperparametes.

actually could be optimized not sure why not ...


q(v) = GP({\textbackslash}mu\_0, S\_0) S\_0 is fixed somehow ..
the data likelihood term is minimized over a weighted combination of all possible deformation fields in family of phi, instead of only at a single deformation phi

In this work, we present Occupancy Flow, a novel spatio-temporal representation of time-varying 3D geometry with implicit correspondences. Towards this goal, we learn a temporally and spatially continuous vector ﬁeld which assigns a motion vector to every point in space and time. In order to perform dense 4D reconstruction from images or sparse point clouds, we combine our method with a continuous 3D representation. Implicitly, our model yields correspondences over time, thus enabling fast inference while providing a sound physical description of the temporal dynamics. We show that our method can be used for interpolation and reconstruction tasks, and demonstrate the accuracy of the learned correspondences. We believe that Occupancy Flow is a promising new 4D representation which will be useful for a variety of spatio-temporal reconstruction tasks.},

	abstract = {Image registration is the process of establishing a common geometric reference frame between two or more image data sets possibly taken at different times. In this paper we present a method for computing elastic registration and warping maps based on the Monge–Kantorovich theory of optimal mass transport. This mass transport method has a number of important characteristics. First, it is parameter free. Moreover, it utilizes all of the grayscale data in both images, places the two images on equal footing and is symmetrical: the optimal mapping from image to ¡ image being the inverse of the optimal mapping ¡ from to  £ ¢ The method does not require that landmarks be specified, and the minimizer of the distance functional involved is unique; there are no other local minimizers. Finally, optimal transport naturally takes into account changes in density that result from changes in area or volume. Although the optimal transport method is certainly not appropriate for all registration and warping problems, this mass preservation property makes the Monge-Kantorovich approach quite useful for an interesting class of warping problems, as we show in this paper. Our method for finding the registration mapping is based on a partial differential equation approach to the minimization of ¤¦ ¥ the Kantorovich–Wasserstein or “Earth Mover’s Distance ” under a mass preservation constraint. We show how this approach leads to practical algorithms, and demonstrate our method with a number of examples, including those from the medical field.

The proposed model is a production of assembling the Wasserstein distance with the Benamou--Brenier formula in optimal transportation and the flow of diffeomorphisms involved in large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping, which is suitable for the scenario of spatiotemporal imaging with large diffeomorphic and mass-preserving deformations. Specifically, we first use the Benamou--Brenier formula to characterize the optimal transport cost among the flow of mass-preserving images, and restrict the velocity field into the admissible Hilbert space to guarantee the generated deformation flow being diffeomorphic. We then gain the ODE-constrained equivalent formulation for Benamou--Brenier formula. We finally obtain the proposed model with ODE constraint following the framework that presented in our previous work. We further get the equivalent PDE-constrained optimal control formulation. The proposed model is compared against several existing alternatives theoretically. The alternating minimization algorithm is presented for solving the time-discretized version of the proposed model with ODE constraint. Several important issues on the proposed model and associated algorithms are also discussed. Particularly, we present several potential models based on the proposed diffeomorphic optimal transportation. Under appropriate conditions, the proposed algorithm also provides a new scheme to solve the models using quadratic Wasserstein distance. The performance is finally evaluated by several numerical experiments in space-time tomography, where the data is measured from the concerned sequential images with sparse views and/or various noise levels.},

	abstract = {Visualization and analysis of intra-operative images in imageguided radiotherapy and surgery are mainly limited to 2D X-ray imaging, which could be beneficially fused with information-rich pre-operative 3D image information by means of 3D-2D image registration. To keep the radiation dose delivered by the X-ray system low, the intra-operative imaging is usually limited to a single projection view. Registration of 3D to a single 2D image is a very challenging registration task for most of current state-of-the-art 3D-2D image registration methods. We propose a novel 3D-2D rigid registration method based on evaluation of similarity between corresponding 3D and 2D gradient covariances, which are mapped into the same space using backprojection. Normalized scalar product of covariances is computed as similarity measure. Performance of the proposed and state-of-the-art 3D-2D image registration methods was evaluated on two publicly available image datasets, one of cerebral angiograms and the other of a spine cadaver, using standardized evaluation methodology. Results showed that the proposed method outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods and achieved registration accuracy of 0.5 mm, capture range of 9 mm and success rate {\textgreater}80\%. Considering also that GPU-enabled execution times ranged from 0.5-2.0 seconds, the proposed method has the potential to enhance with 3D information the visualization and analysis of intra-operative 2D images.},

Among the existing methods, nonparametric registration algorithms such as optical flow, or Demons, usually have the advantage of being fast and easy to use. Recently, a diffeomorphic version of the Demons algorithm was proposed. This provides the advantage of producing invertible displacement fields, which is a necessary condition for these to be physical. However, such methods are based on the matching of intensities and are not suitable for registering images with different contrast enhancement. In such cases, a registration method based on the local phase like the Morphons has to be used. In this paper, a diffeomorphic version of the Morphons registration method is proposed and compared to conventional Morphons, Demons, and diffeomorphic Demons. The method is validated in the context of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients on several 4D respiratory-correlated CT scans of the thorax with and without variable contrast enhancement.},

We use an optimal control formulation, in which the velocity field of a hyperbolic PDE needs to be found such that the distance between the final state of the system (the transformed/transported template image) and the observation (the reference image) is minimized. Our solver supports both stationary and non-stationary (i.e., transient or time-dependent) velocity fields. As transformation models, we consider both the transport equation (assuming intensities are preserved during the deformation) and the continuity equation (assuming mass-preservation). We consider the reduced form of the optimal control problem and solve the resulting unconstrained optimization problem using a discretize-then-optimize approach. A key contribution is the elimination of the PDE constraint using a Lagrangian hyperbolic PDE solver. Lagrangian methods rely on the concept of characteristic curves that we approximate here using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. We also present an efficient algorithm for computing the derivatives of final state of the system with respect to the velocity field. This allows us to use fast Gauss-Newton based methods. We present quickly converging iterative linear solvers using spectral preconditioners that render the overall optimization efficient and scalable. Our method is embedded into the image registration framework FAIR and, thus, supports the most commonly used similarity measures and regularization functionals. We demonstrate the potential of our new approach using several synthetic and real world test problems with up to 14.7 million degrees of freedom.},

Here, we propose a generative model extending least squares linear regression to the space of images by using a second-order dynamic formulation for image registration. Unlike previous approaches, the formulation allows for a compact representation of an approximation to the full spatio-temporal trajectory through its initial values. The method also opens up possibilities to design image-based approximation algorithms. The resulting optimization problem is solved using an adjoint method.},

Our key contribution is a Bayesian inference procedure for model parameter estimation and simultaneous detection of the eﬀective dimensionality of the latent space. We evaluate our proposed model for atlas and principal geodesic estimation on the OASIS brain database of magnetic resonance images. We show that the automatically selected latent dimensions from our model are able to reconstruct unseen brain images with lower error than equivalent linear principal components analysis (LPCA) models in the image space, and it also outperforms tangent space PCA (TPCA) models in the diﬀeomorphism setting.},

	abstract = {In image-guided neurosurgery, current commercial systems usually provide only rigid registration, partly because it is harder to predict, validate and understand non-rigid registration error. For instance, when surgeons see a discrepancy in aligned image features, they may not be able to distinguish between registration error and actual tissue deformation caused by tumor resection. In this case, the spatial distribution of registration error could help them make more informed decisions, e.g., ignoring the registration where the estimated error is high. However, error estimates are difficult to acquire. Probabilistic image registration (PIR) methods provide measures of registration uncertainty, which could be a surrogate for assessing the registration error. It is intuitive and believed by many clinicians that high uncertainty indicates a large error. However, the monotonic association between uncertainty and error has not been examined in image registration literature. In this pilot study, we attempt to address this fundamental problem by looking at one PIR method, the Gaussian process (GP) registration. We systematically investigate the relation between GP uncertainty and error based on clinical data and show empirically that there is a weak-to-moderate positive monotonic correlation between point-wise GP registration uncertainty and non-rigid registration error.},

These tasks require a fundamental tool called parallel transport of tangent vectors along arbitrary paths. This tool is essential for: (1) computation of geodesic paths using either shooting or path-straightening method, (2) transferring deformations across objects, and (3) modeling of statistical variability in shapes. Using the square-root normal ﬁeld (SRNF) representation of parameterized surfaces, we present a method for transporting deformations along paths in the shape space. This is difﬁcult despite the underlying space being a vector space because the chosen (elastic) Riemannian metric is non-standard. Using a ﬁnite-basis for representing SRNFs of shapes, we derive expressions for Christoffel symbols that enable parallel transports. We demonstrate this framework using examples from shape analysis of parameterized spherical surfaces, in the three contexts mentioned above.},

In contrast to the most similar algorithms, which achieve small computation times by truncated search, our algorithm uses a novel randomized projection to accelerate feature comparison and to enable global search. Further, we demonstrate robust estimation of non-rigid transformations with a novel probabilistic correspondence framework, that enables large TEM images to be rapidly brought into alignment, removing characteristic distortions of the tissue fixation and imaging process. We analyze the impact of randomized projections upon correspondence detection, and upon transformation accuracy, and demonstrate that accuracy is maintained. We provide experimental results that demonstrate significant reduction in computation time and successful alignment of TEM images.},

The posterior distribution is characterized using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with the effect of the Boltzmann temperature hyper-parameters marginalized under broad uninformative hyper-prior distributions. The MCMC chain permits estimation of the most likely deformation as well as the associated uncertainty. On synthetic examples, we demonstrate the ability of the method to identify the maximum a posteriori estimate and the associated posterior uncertainty, and demonstrate that the posterior distribution can be non-Gaussian. Additionally, results from registering clinical data acquired during neurosurgery for resection of brain tumor are provided; we compare the method to single transformation results from a deterministic optimizer and introduce methods that summarize the high-dimensional uncertainty. At the site of resection, the registration uncertainty increases and the marginal distribution on deformations is shown to be multi-modal.},

The diﬀeomorphic non-rigid registration is a validated instrument for the detection of anatomical changes on medical images and is based on a rich mathematical background. For instance, the “large deformation diﬀeomorphic metric mapping” framework deﬁnes a Riemannian setting by providing an opportune right invariant metric on the tangent space, and solves the registration problem by computing geodesics parametrized by time-varying velocity ﬁelds. In alternative, stationary velocity ﬁelds have been proposed for the diﬀeomorphic registration based on the oneparameter subgroups from Lie groups theory. In spite of the higher computational eﬃciency, the geometric setting of the latter method is more vague, especially regarding the relationship between one-parameter subgroups and geodesics. In this study, we present the relevant properties of the Lie groups for the deﬁnition of geometrical properties within the one-parameter subgroups parametrization, and we deﬁne the geometric structure for computing geodesics and for parallel transporting. The theoretical results are applied to the image registration context, and discussed in light of the practical computational problems.},

	abstract = {Image registration is a key technique in medical image analysis to estimate deformations between image pairs. A good deformation model is important for high-quality estimates. However, most existing approaches use ad-hoc deformation models chosen for mathematical convenience rather than to capture observed data variation. Recent deep learning approaches learn deformation models directly from data. However, they provide limited control over the spatial regularity of transformations. Instead of learning the entire registration approach, we learn a spatially-adaptive regularizer within a registration model. This allows controlling the desired level of regularity and preserving structural properties of a registration model. For example, diffeomorphic transformations can be attained. Our approach is a radical departure from existing deep learning approaches to image registration by embedding a deep learning model in an optimization-based registration algorithm to parameterize and data-adapt the registration model itself.},

The method relies on a fully convolutional network whose architecture consists of contracting layers to detect relevant features and a symmetric expanding path that matches them together and outputs the transformation parametrization. Whereas convolutional networks have seen a widespread expansion and have been already applied to many medical imaging problems such as segmentation and classification, its application to registration has so far faced the challenge of defining ground truth data on which to train the algorithm. Here, we present a novel training strategy to build reference deformations which relies on the registration of segmented regions of interest. We apply this methodology to the problem of inter-patient heart registration and show an important improvement over a state of the art optimization based algorithm. Not only our method is more accurate but it is also faster - registration of two 3D-images taking less than 30 ms second on a GPU - and more robust to outliers.},

Quicksilver registration for image-pairs works by patch-wise prediction of a deformation model based directly on image appearance. A deep encoder-decoder network is used as the prediction model. While the prediction strategy is general, we focus on predictions for the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) model. Specifically, we predict the momentum-parameterization of LDDMM, which facilitates a patch-wise prediction strategy while maintaining the theoretical properties of LDDMM, such as guaranteed diffeomorphic mappings for sufficiently strong regularization. We also provide a probabilistic version of our prediction network which can be sampled during the testing time to calculate uncertainties in the predicted deformations. Finally, we introduce a new correction network which greatly increases the prediction accuracy of an already existing prediction network. We show experimental results for uni-modal atlas-to-image as well as uni- / multi- modal image-to-image registrations. These experiments demonstrate that our method accurately predicts registrations obtained by numerical optimization, is very fast, achieves state-of-the-art registration results on four standard validation datasets, and can jointly learn an image similarity measure.

	abstract = {Landmark matching via geodesic shooting is a prerequisite task for numerous registration based applications in biomedicine. Geodesic shooting has been developed as one solution approach and formulates the diffeomorphic registration as an optimal control problem under the Hamiltonian framework. In this framework, with landmark positions q0 fixed, the problem solely depends on the initial momentum p0 and evolves through time steps according to a set of constraint equations. Given an initial p0, the algorithm flows q and p forward through time steps, calculates a loss based on point-set mismatch and kinetic energy, back-propagate through time to calculate gradient on p0 and update it. In the forward and backward pass, a pair-wise kernel on landmark points K and additional intermediate terms have to be calculated and marginalized, leading to O(N2) computational complexity, N being the number of points to be registered. For medical image applications, N maybe in the range of thousands, rendering this operation computationally expensive. In this work we ropose a CUDA implementation based on shared memory reduction. Our implementation achieves nearly 2 orders magnitude speed up compared to a naive CPU-based implementation, in addition to improved numerical accuracy as well as better registration results.},

This property allows us to generate and store complex deformations with the help of one initial “momentum” which serves as the initial state of a differential equation in the group of diffeomorphisms. Moreover, it is shown that this momentum can be also used for describing a deformation of given visual structures, like points, contours or images, and that, it has the same dimension as the described object, as a consequence of the normal momentum constraint we introduce.},

extension of lddmm for landmark matching to optimize for initial momenta instead of time varying velocity

note this formulation only works for landmarks ... not sure about images


in a sense, the kernel function K repr. rkhs V can be interpreted as covariance for velocity fields, if v is mvn or gaussian process.

 
introduction 

idea

represent geodesic flow as solely initial momentum and template image
benefit

linear repr.
much smaller \# parameters




notations

G: group of diffeomorphisms of template I\_x

e.g. any diff transformation that maps I\_x to other images is in G


V: tangent space at Id {\textbackslash}in G

also a Hilbert space of sufficiently smooth smooth velocity fields with compact support, e.g. L2({\textbackslash}Omega)
can assume V is rkhs !


V*: dual space of initial momentum

dual space are space of linear functionals, mapping vectors on tangent space to underlying field, e.g. reals


L: V -{\textgreater} V* maps to dual space

e.g. m = Lv {\textbackslash}in V* where v{\textbackslash}in V and m: V -{\textgreater} R


K:V" -{\textgreater} V inverse of L

e.g. v = Km
actually operationally, velocity = K*momentum ... so in a way. kernel function K which repr. rkhs V is inverse of L ?


q1...qN: landmark points in {\textbackslash}Omega

q(0) = x moving landmarks !


q dot: velocities dq/dt
p = S{\textasciicircum}-1 q

p(0) is momentum




discovery ...

josh [2000] paper on lddmm landmark matching paper found that

velocity is interpolated over entire domain depends on trajectories of landmarks only !

v = K(X,X){\textasciicircum}-1 m interpolation step !.
v(X*) = K(X*,X) K(X,X){\textasciicircum}-1 m at grid location X*


integrand of smoothness term similar to kinetic energy form ... quadratic wrt q

L(q,qdot,t) as integrant


time varying diff transformation, moving landmarks and momentum is determined entirely by (x,m) !




variational problem on initial momentim!

energy as hamiltonian

which is conserved ! so H(q(t),p(t)) = H(q(0),p(0)) = H(x,v) where x is fixex landmarks v is initial momentum
H = {\textless}v, K{\textasciicircum}-1 v{\textgreater} = {\textless}m, Km{\textgreater}

since v = Km.




energy is now a function of v!

smoothness term is just quadratic wrt kernel matrix (computed from x)


K is gaussian kernel ...
