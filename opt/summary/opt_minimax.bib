	abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks ({GANs}) excel at creating realistic images with complex models for which maximum likelihood is infeasible. However, the convergence of {GAN} training has still not been proved. We propose a two time-scale update rule ({TTUR}) for training {GANs} with stochastic gradient descent on arbitrary {GAN} loss functions. {TTUR} has an individual learning rate for both the discriminator and the generator. Using the theory of stochastic approximation, we prove that the {TTUR} converges under mild assumptions to a stationary local Nash equilibrium. The convergence carries over to the popular Adam optimization, for which we prove that it follows the dynamics of a heavy ball with friction and thus prefers flat minima in the objective landscape. For the evaluation of the performance of {GANs} at image generation, we introduce the "Fr{\textbackslash}'echet Inception Distance" ({FID}) which captures the similarity of generated images to real ones better than the Inception Score. In experiments, {TTUR} improves learning for {DCGANs} and Improved Wasserstein {GANs} ({WGAN}-{GP}) outperforming conventional {GAN} training on {CelebA}, {CIFAR}-10, {SVHN}, {LSUN} Bedrooms, and the One Billion Word Benchmark.},

	abstract = {We consider nonconvex-concave minimax problems, \${\textbackslash}min\_\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}\} {\textbackslash}max\_\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{y\} {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathcal\{Y\}\} f({\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}, {\textbackslash}mathbf\{y\})\$, where \$f\$ is nonconvex in \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}\$ but concave in \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{y\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{Y\}\$ is a convex and bounded set. One of the most popular algorithms for solving this problem is the celebrated gradient descent ascent ({GDA}) algorithm, which has been widely used in machine learning, control theory and economics. Despite the extensive convergence results for the convex-concave setting, {GDA} with equal stepsize can converge to limit cycles or even diverge in a general setting. In this paper, we present the complexity results on two-time-scale {GDA} for solving nonconvex-concave minimax problems, showing that the algorithm can find a stationary point of the function \${\textbackslash}Phi({\textbackslash}cdot) := {\textbackslash}max\_\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{y\} {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathcal\{Y\}\} f({\textbackslash}cdot, {\textbackslash}mathbf\{y\})\$ efficiently.

	abstract = {Many tasks in modern machine learning can be formulated as finding equilibria in {\textbackslash}emph\{sequential\} games. In particular, two-player zero-sum sequential games, also known as minimax optimization, have received growing interest. It is tempting to apply gradient descent to solve minimax optimization given its popularity and success in supervised learning. However, it has been noted that naive application of gradient descent fails to find some local minimax and can converge to non-local-minimax points. In this paper, we propose {\textbackslash}emph\{Follow-the-Ridge\} ({FR}), a novel algorithm that provably converges to and only converges to local minimax. We show theoretically that the algorithm addresses the notorious rotational behaviour of gradient dynamics, and is compatible with preconditioning and {\textbackslash}emph\{positive\} momentum. Empirically, {FR} solves toy minimax problems and improves the convergence of {GAN} training compared to the recent minimax optimization algorithms.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new algorithm for the numerical computation of Nash equilibria of competitive two-player games. Our method is a natural generalization of gradient descent to the two-player setting where the update is given by the Nash equilibrium of a regularized bilinear local approximation of the underlying game. It avoids oscillatory and divergent behaviors seen in alternating gradient descent. Using numerical experiments and rigorous analysis, we provide a detailed comparison to methods based on {\textbackslash}emph\{optimism\} and {\textbackslash}emph\{consensus\} and show that our method avoids making any unnecessary changes to the gradient dynamics while achieving exponential (local) convergence for (locally) convex-concave zero sum games. Convergence and stability properties of our method are robust to strong interactions between the players, without adapting the stepsize, which is not the case with previous methods. In our numerical experiments on non-convex-concave problems, existing methods are prone to divergence and instability due to their sensitivity to interactions among the players, whereas we never observe divergence of our algorithm. The ability to choose larger stepsizes furthermore allows our algorithm to achieve faster convergence, as measured by the number of model evaluations.},

We show that the same holds true in the more general problem of \{{\textbackslash}em constrained\} min-max optimization under a variant of the no-regret Multiplicative-Weights-Update method called "Optimistic Multiplicative-Weights Update ({OMWU})". This answers an open question of Syrgkanis et al{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}cite\{{SALS}15\}. The proof of our result requires fundamentally different techniques from those that exist in no-regret learning literature and the aforementioned papers. We show that {OMWU} monotonically improves the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the current iterate to the (appropriately normalized) min-max solution until it enters a neighborhood of the solution. Inside that neighborhood we show that {OMWU} becomes a contracting map converging to the exact solution. We believe that our techniques will be useful in the analysis of the last iterate of other learning algorithms.},

	abstract = {Generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) are capable of producing high quality samples, but they suffer from numerous issues such as instability and mode collapse during training. To combat this, we propose to model the generator and discriminator as agents acting under local information, uncertainty, and awareness of their opponent. By doing so we achieve stable convergence, even when the underlying game has no Nash equilibria. We call this mechanism implicit competitive regularization ({ICR}) and show that it is present in the recently proposed competitive gradient descent ({CGD}). When comparing {CGD} to Adam using a variety of loss functions and regularizers on {CIFAR}10, {CGD} shows a much more consistent performance, which we attribute to {ICR}. In our experiments, we achieve the highest inception score when using the {WGAN} loss (without gradient penalty or weight clipping) together with {CGD}. This can be interpreted as minimizing a form of integral probability metric based on {ICR}.},

	abstract = {Multi-agent settings are quickly gathering importance in machine learning. This includes a plethora of recent work on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, but also can be extended to hierarchical {RL}, generative adversarial networks and decentralised optimisation. In all these settings the presence of multiple learning agents renders the training problem non-stationary and often leads to unstable training or undesired final results. We present Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness ({LOLA}), a method in which each agent shapes the anticipated learning of the other agents in the environment. The {LOLA} learning rule includes a term that accounts for the impact of one agent's policy on the anticipated parameter update of the other agents. Results show that the encounter of two {LOLA} agents leads to the emergence of tit-for-tat and therefore cooperation in the iterated prisoners' dilemma, while independent learning does not. In this domain, {LOLA} also receives higher payouts compared to a naive learner, and is robust against exploitation by higher order gradient-based methods. Applied to repeated matching pennies, {LOLA} agents converge to the Nash equilibrium. In a round robin tournament we show that {LOLA} agents successfully shape the learning of a range of multi-agent learning algorithms from literature, resulting in the highest average returns on the {IPD}. We also show that the {LOLA} update rule can be efficiently calculated using an extension of the policy gradient estimator, making the method suitable for model-free {RL}. The method thus scales to large parameter and input spaces and nonlinear function approximators. We apply {LOLA} to a grid world task with an embedded social dilemma using recurrent policies and opponent modelling. By explicitly considering the learning of the other agent, {LOLA} agents learn to cooperate out of self-interest. The code is at github.com/alshedivat/lola.},

In this paper, we show that the requirement of absolute continuity is necessary: we describe a simple yet prototypical counterexample showing that in the more realistic case of distributions that are not absolutely continuous, unregularized {GAN} training is not always convergent. Furthermore, we discuss regularization strategies that were recently proposed to stabilize {GAN} training. Our analysis shows that {GAN} training with instance noise or zero-centered gradient penalties converges. On the other hand, we show that Wasserstein-{GANs} and {WGAN}-{GP} with a finite number of discriminator updates per generator update do not always converge to the equilibrium point. We discuss these results, leading us to a new explanation for the stability problems of {GAN} training. Based on our analysis, we extend our convergence results to more general {GANs} and prove local convergence for simplified gradient penalties even if the generator and data distribution lie on lower dimensional manifolds. We find these penalties to work well in practice and use them to learn high-resolution generative image models for a variety of datasets with little hyperparameter tuning.},

	abstract = {Minimax optimization has found extensive applications in modern machine learning, in settings such as generative adversarial networks ({GANs}), adversarial training and multi-agent reinforcement learning. As most of these applications involve continuous nonconvex-nonconcave formulations, a very basic question arises---``what is a proper definition of local optima?'' Most previous work answers this question using classical notions of equilibria from simultaneous games, where the min-player and the max-player act simultaneously. In contrast, most applications in machine learning, including {GANs} and adversarial training, correspond to sequential games, where the order of which player acts first is crucial (since minimax is in general not equal to maximin due to the nonconvex-nonconcave nature of the problems). The main contribution of this paper is to propose a proper mathematical definition of local optimality for this sequential setting---local minimax, as well as to present its properties and existence results. Finally, we establish a strong connection to a basic local search algorithm---gradient descent ascent ({GDA}): under mild conditions, all stable limit points of {GDA} are exactly local minimax points up to some degenerate points.},

	abstract = {We address the issue of limit cycling behavior in training Generative Adversarial Networks and propose the use of Optimistic Mirror Decent ({OMD}) for training Wasserstein {GANs}. Recent theoretical results have shown that optimistic mirror decent ({OMD}) can enjoy faster regret rates in the context of zero-sum games. {WGANs} is exactly a context of solving a zero-sum game with simultaneous no-regret dynamics. Moreover, we show that optimistic mirror decent addresses the limit cycling problem in training {WGANs}. We formally show that in the case of bi-linear zero-sum games the last iterate of {OMD} dynamics converges to an equilibrium, in contrast to {GD} dynamics which are bound to cycle. We also portray the huge qualitative difference between {GD} and {OMD} dynamics with toy examples, even when {GD} is modified with many adaptations proposed in the recent literature, such as gradient penalty or momentum. We apply {OMD} {WGAN} training to a bioinformatics problem of generating {DNA} sequences. We observe that models trained with {OMD} achieve consistently smaller {KL} divergence with respect to the true underlying distribution, than models trained with {GD} variants. Finally, we introduce a new algorithm, Optimistic Adam, which is an optimistic variant of Adam. We apply it to {WGAN} training on {CIFAR}10 and observe improved performance in terms of inception score as compared to Adam.},

	abstract = {Convergence to a saddle point for convex-concave functions has been studied for decades, while the last few years have seen a surge of interest in non-convex-non-concave min-max optimization due to the rise of deep learning. However, it remains an intriguing research challenge how local optimal points are defined and which algorithm can converge to such points. We study definitions of "local min-max (max-min)" points and provide an elegant unification, with the corresponding first- and second-order necessary and sufficient conditions. Specifically, we show that quadratic games, as often used as illustrative examples and approximations of smooth functions, are too special, both locally and globally. Lastly, we analyze the exact conditions for local convergence of several popular gradient algorithms near the "local min-max" points defined in the previous section, identify "valid" hyper-parameters and compare the respective stable sets. Our results offer insights into the necessity of two-time-scale algorithms and the limitation of the commonly used approach based on ordinary differential equations.},

	abstract = {Regularized learning is a fundamental technique in online optimization, machine learning and many other fields of computer science. A natural question that arises in these settings is how regularized learning algorithms behave when faced against each other. We study a natural formulation of this problem by coupling regularized learning dynamics in zero-sum games. We show that the system's behavior is Poincar{\textbackslash}'e recurrent, implying that almost every trajectory revisits any (arbitrarily small) neighborhood of its starting point infinitely often. This cycling behavior is robust to the agents' choice of regularization mechanism (each agent could be using a different regularizer), to positive-affine transformations of the agents' utilities, and it also persists in the case of networked competition, i.e., for zero-sum polymatrix games.},

	abstract = {Owing to their connection with generative adversarial networks ({GANs}), saddle-point problems have recently attracted considerable interest in machine learning and beyond. By necessity, most theoretical guarantees revolve around convex-concave (or even linear) problems; however, making theoretical inroads towards efficient {GAN} training depends crucially on moving beyond this classic framework. To make piecemeal progress along these lines, we analyze the behavior of mirror descent ({MD}) in a class of non-monotone problems whose solutions coincide with those of a naturally associated variational inequality - a property which we call coherence. We first show that ordinary, "vanilla" {MD} converges under a strict version of this condition, but not otherwise; in particular, it may fail to converge even in bilinear models with a unique solution. We then show that this deficiency is mitigated by optimism: by taking an "extra-gradient" step, optimistic mirror descent ({OMD}) converges in all coherent problems. Our analysis generalizes and extends the results of Daskalakis et al. (2018) for optimistic gradient descent ({OGD}) in bilinear problems, and makes concrete headway for establishing convergence beyond convex-concave games. We also provide stochastic analogues of these results, and we validate our analysis by numerical experiments in a wide array of {GAN} models (including Gaussian mixture models, as well as the {CelebA} and {CIFAR}-10 datasets).},

This addresses a question of Daskalakis et al 2011. Further, we consider a partial information version of the problem.

Proving last-iterate convergence is challenging because many natural algorithms, such as Simultaneous Gradient Descent/Ascent, provably diverge or cycle even in simple convex-concave min-max settings, and previous work on global last-iterate convergence rates has been limited to the bilinear and convex-strongly concave settings. In this work, we show that the Hamiltonian Gradient Descent ({HGD}) algorithm achieves linear convergence in a variety of more general settings, including convex-concave problems that satisfy a "sufficiently bilinear" condition. We also prove similar convergence rates for the Consensus Optimization ({CO}) algorithm of [{MNG}17] for some parameter settings of {CO}.},
