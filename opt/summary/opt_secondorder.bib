	abstract = {In this paper we derive efficiency estimates of the regularized Newton's method as applied to constrained convex minimization problems and to variational inequalities. We study a one-step Newton's method and its multistep accelerated version, which converges on smooth convex problems as O(1/k), where k is the iteration counter. We derive also the efficiency estimate of a second-order scheme for smooth variational inequalities. Its global rate of convergence is established on the level O (1/k).},

	abstract = {In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis for a cubic regularization of Newton method as applied to unconstrained minimization
problem. For this scheme, we prove general local convergence results. However, the main contribution of the paper is related
to global worst-case complexity bounds for different problem classes including some nonconvex cases. It is shown that the
search direction can be computed by standard linear algebra technique.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10107-006-0089-x},
	abstract = {In this paper we propose an accelerated version of the cubic regularization of Newton’s method (Nesterov and Polyak, in Math
Program 108(1): 177–205, 2006). The original version, used for minimizing a convex function with Lipschitz-continuous Hessian,
guarantees a global rate of convergence of order O([1/(k2)])O{\textbackslash}big(\{1 {\textbackslash}over k{\textasciicircum}2\}{\textbackslash}big), where k is the iteration counter. Our modified version converges for the same problem class with order O([1/(k3)])O{\textbackslash}big(\{1 {\textbackslash}over k{\textasciicircum}3\}{\textbackslash}big), keeping the complexity of each iteration unchanged. We study the complexity of both schemes on different classes of convex
problems. In particular, we argue that for the second-order schemes, the class of non-degenerate problems is different from
the standard class.},
