	abstract = {We propose an independence criterion based on the eigenspectrum of covariance operators in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces ({RKHSs}), consisting of an empirical estimate of the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the cross-covariance operator (we term this a Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion, or {HSIC}). This approach has several advantages, compared with previous kernel-based independence criteria. First, the empirical estimate is simpler than any other kernel dependence test, and requires no user-deﬁned regularisation. Second, there is a clearly deﬁned population quantity which the empirical estimate approaches in the large sample limit, with exponential convergence guaranteed between the two: this ensures that independence tests based on {HSIC} do not suffer from slow learning rates. Finally, we show in the context of independent component analysis ({ICA}) that the performance of {HSIC} is competitive with that of previously published kernel-based criteria, and of other recently published {ICA} methods.},
