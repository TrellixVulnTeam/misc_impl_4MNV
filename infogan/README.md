+ blog post on variational bound on MI https://www.inference.vc/infogan-variational-bound-on-mutual-information-twice/
    + there is a paper on variational lower bound of MI very recently https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06922.pdf
    + InfoGAN idea
        + new term in loss encourages high MI between generated samples and small subset of latent variables. Want to capture most interesting aspects of the representation in c
