	title = {Hilbert Space Embeddings and Metrics on Probability Measures},
	abstract = {A Hilbert space embedding for probability measures has recently been proposed, with applications including dimensionality reduction, homogeneity testing, and independence testing. This embedding represents any probability measure as a mean element in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space ({RKHS}). A pseudometric on the space of probability measures can be deﬁned as the distance between distribution embeddings: we denote this as γk, indexed by the kernel function k that deﬁnes the inner product in the {RKHS}.},

@article{rahimiRandomFeaturesLargeScale,
	title = {Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines},
	abstract = {To accelerate the training of kernel machines, we propose to map the input data to a randomized low-dimensional feature space and then apply existing fast linear methods. Our randomized features are designed so that the inner products of the transformed data are approximately equal to those in the feature space of a user speciﬁed shift-invariant kernel. We explore two sets of random features, provide convergence bounds on their ability to approximate various radial basis kernels, and show that in large-scale classiﬁcation and regression tasks linear machine learning algorithms that use these features outperform state-of-the-art large-scale kernel machines.},
